# Abstract
This project aims to develop a user-friendly network monitoring and intrusion detection system that enables users to inspect and monitor hosts connected to their network, analyze their connections to the internet, and evaluate internet protocol metrics. The system focuses ondetecting and preventing intrusions, with a specific emphasis on mitigating Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks through Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing. By leveraging advanced monitoring techniques and machine learning algorithms, the system can detect suspicious network activities and provide real-time alerts to administrators. The project aims to enhance network security, empower administrators with insights into network traffic, and enable timely responses to potential threats.
